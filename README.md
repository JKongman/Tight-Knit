# Tight-Knit
**Social Media Application** that pushes the user to join groups of like minded interest and hobbies, but with a twist of a voting function.
The Application primarily focuses on users being able to join a group, chat, upload and edit their profile and vote on users within their group.
The voting function focuses on users who are inactive within the group or who are not a great fit within the other members.
By limiting the group size, we are able to use the 3/5 vote out method. Where members of the group have to agree to the majority to vote a user out.
